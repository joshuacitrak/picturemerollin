There was dirt in my hair, tooth grit crunching in my mouth and my fingers were so numb I couldn’t work the key into the lock. One of our neighbors had to let me in the building.</p>
                    <p>“Six B? You’re in six B, right?”
	I nodded, jiggled the latch, blubbered something incoherent through the
balled up shirt I was using to mop my blood mustache.
	“Hold on, I’m a-comin’,” he said, pulling one of those two wheel pull
carts through the lobby like it were an old dog. “Say now — what happened to
you? You fall or somethin’?”
I	 was probably twelve at the time, I guess. Mom’s latest boyfriend, Jack,
had moved us in with him over the weekend. His apartment wasn’t so far from
our old place that I had to start a new school, but it was in a different
neighborhood, the rough Western Addition; I was the new kid all the same. I
didn’t know anybody on my block and the beat down I’d just suffered behind the
row of Section 8’s between home and school was a bitter introduction to my new
zip code.</p>"
